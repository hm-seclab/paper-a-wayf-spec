# A-WAYF: Automated Where Are You From in Multilateral Federations

A-WAYF is a automated Where Are You From (WAYF) solution that is both user-friendly and privacy preserving.

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper _A-WAYF: Automated Where Are You From in Multilateral Federations_.
We publish a [proof of concept (PoC)](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-a-wayf-spec/tree/main/non-browser-poc) implementation of our client application, a virtual authenticator supporting A-WAYF, and the [modified solo firmware](https://github.com/hm-seclab/awayf-solo1?tab=readme-ov-file#build-locally)
that implements A-WAYF for the [Solo Hacker FIDO2 authenticator](https://solokeys.com/collections/all/products/solo-hacker).
If you want to replicate the PoC, you can follow the [testing documentation](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-a-wayf-spec/blob/main/Testing.md).
