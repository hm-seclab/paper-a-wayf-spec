- The modified solo [firmware](https://github.com/hm-seclab/awayf-solo1?tab=readme-ov-file#build-locally) that implements A-WAYF for the [Solo Hacker](https://solokeys.com/collections/all/products/solo-hacker) FIDO2 authenticator.
- A virtual authenticator with support for A-WAYF.
- The testing [documentation](https://github.com/hm-seclab/paper-a-wayf-spec/blob/main/Testing.md) to replicate the PoC.
