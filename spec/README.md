# WAYF Extension

This folder contains a description of the extension
proposed by A-WAYF: Automated Where Are You From in 
Multilateral Federations.

To build the `.xml` and text documents from the markdown file
you need [kramdown-rfc](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc)
and [xml2rfc](https://github.com/ietf-tools/xml2rfc). After
you've installed the required dependencies just run
`./build.sh` from within this directory.
