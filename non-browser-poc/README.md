# POC (non-browser)

This is a proof of concept implementation for the 
A-WAYF: Automated Where Are You From in Multilateral Federations
paper.

## Get started

The following dependencies are required to build the project:

* [Zig 0.11.0](https://ziglang.org/download/)

After you've installed all required dependencies run `zig build` to
build the authenticator and client executables. The executables will
be placed into `./zig-out/bin/`.

> TODO: fork the solokeys firmware, modify it and add it as submodule to the repo.
